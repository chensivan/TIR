## What

This paper studied the challenges in goal-oriented discussion through a group chat, and designed a chatbot to help improve the efficiency for reaching consensus and encouraging more evenly participantion among group members.

## Prior work

Groups are more likely to reach consensus if preauthorized structure and script is provided [1].

## Design needs and goals

Through a survye on MTurk, the authors arrived at three goals:

1. Challenge: Group chat can be slow and inefficient
   - Design goal: support the groups to reach consensus in a timely manner with a discussion procedure
2. Challenge: Even contributions enhance group coherence but it's difficult to have even contributions.
   - Design goal: encourage even contributions to improve discussion satisfaction.
3. Challenging: organizing members' diverse opinions is challenging
   - Design goal: Aggregate and organize diverse opinions to reduce participants' cognitive load

## Some discussions

- By encouraing more evenly participation (e.g., driving lurkers to speak), one can facilitate the group dynamics.
- Chat bot can serve different roles (act like a member) rather than just a tool. This is consistent with prior research where they found that a bot can provide diverse functions including sharing of information, explaining moderation, and prompting the streamer [2].
